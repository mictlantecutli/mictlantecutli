Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! You've found the right place. Let me tell you a little about myselfâ€”I'm a Software Development student at BYU-Idaho, a journey that I believe was nothing short of a miracle, and perhaps, I was meant to be here all along. It all began as a dream of becoming self-reliant, though I lost my way for a time. But the dream returned, this time with a focus on building my own websites. Little did I know, I would dive into the amazing world of programming. Now, Iâ€™m fascinated by fields like Big Data and the Internet of Things, always eager to explore what's next!

## About Me
Iâ€™m currently working on an application that helps schools, parents, and students manage payments and school services. This project has been a great learning experience, especially with PHP and the Laravel framework. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve been doing:

- âœ… Designed an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) for the app using MySQL Workbench.
- âœ… Created database migrations and seeded data for testing in Laravel.
- âœ… Developed controllers and dynamic views with Laravel Livewire for real-time updates.
- âœ… Implemented JavaScript for accurate discount calculations on services.

My short-term goal is to become a back-end developer and collaborate with companies and businesses in Mexico to bring their real-world ideas into the realm of objects, streamlining their operations and driving efficiency.
