# Mois√©s Parra Lozano

Welcome to the underworld of codeüëæüë®‚Äçüíª! 

Iam Moises Parra, and this is my digital sanctuary. Here, my projects come to life from depths. Let me tell you a little about myself‚ÄîI'm a Software Development student at BYU-Idaho, a journey that I believe was nothing short of a miracle, and perhaps, I was meant to be here all along. It all began as a dream of becoming self-reliant, though I lost my way for a time. But the dream returned, this time with a focus on building my own websites. Little did I know, I would dive into the amazing world of programming. Now, I‚Äôm fascinated by fields like Big Data and the Internet of Things, always eager to explore what's next!

## About Me
I‚Äôm currently working on an application that helps schools, parents, and students manage payments and school services. This project has been a great learning experience, especially with PHP and the Laravel framework. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what I‚Äôve been doing:

- ‚úÖ Designed an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) for the app using MySQL Workbench.
- ‚úÖ Created database migrations and seeded data for testing in Laravel.
- ‚úÖ Developed controllers and dynamic views with Laravel Livewire for real-time updates.
- ‚úÖ Implemented JavaScript for accurate discount calculations on services.

My short-term goal is to become a back-end developer and collaborate with companies and businesses in Mexico to bring their real-world ideas into the realm of objects, streamlining their operations and driving efficiency.
