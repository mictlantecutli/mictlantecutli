Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! You've found the right place. Let me tell you a little about myselfâ€”I'm a Software Development student at BYU-Idaho, a journey that I believe was nothing short of a miracle, and perhaps, I was meant to be here all along. It all began as a dream of becoming self-reliant, though I lost my way for a time. But the dream returned, this time with a focus on building my own websites. Little did I know, I would dive into the amazing world of programming. Now, Iâ€™m fascinated by fields like Big Data and the Internet of Things, always eager to explore what's next!

## About Me
Iâ€™m currently working on an application that helps schools, parents, and students manage payments and school services. This project has been a great learning experience, especially with PHP and the Laravel framework. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve been doing:

âœ… Designed an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) for the app using MySQL Workbench.
âœ… Created database migrations and seeded data for testing in Laravel.
âœ… Developed controllers and dynamic views with Laravel Livewire for real-time updates.
âœ… Implemented JavaScript for accurate discount calculations on services.

My short-term goal is to become a back-end developer and collaborate with companies and businesses in Mexico to bring their real-world ideas into the realm of objects, streamlining their operations and driving efficiency.
